# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. USE THE BLOX CONFIG WINDOW TO ADD YOUR
# CUSTOM TYPES TO BE SCANNED. Window > Blox > Blox Config
#
# This file tells the Blox scanner which namespaces and types to include.
# Each entry must be on its own line and in the format: "Namespace.Type, AssemblyName".
# [include] supports wild-cards in the form of ".*", ex: "UnityEngine.*".
# "*, AssemblyName" can be used to include all from a specific assembly.
# [exclude] can be used to specify types to exclude.
# A custom category root can be specified by adding [custom.path] to the end of an entry under [include] category.
# Order number can be set via {180}. It must appear last in line of text.
# ex. Blox, BloxEngine [Flow] {180}
# Entry starting with "!" is disabled by default.
# Restart Unity after making changes to this file.
