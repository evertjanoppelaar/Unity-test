      frame as Awake if the script is not enabled at initialisation time.The Awake
      function is called on all objects in the scene before any object''s Start function
      is called. This fact is useful in cases where object A''s initialisation code
      needs to rely on object B''s already being initialised; B''s initialisation
      should be done in Awake while A''s should be done in Start.Where objects are

      As long as the Variable is not defined or its value is 0.0 or less (it makes

      (each time it is called) as long as the value is higher than 0.0 and once it
      reaches 0.0 or less it will execute the child Blocks and then stop doing anything
      until the Variable is reset to a value higher than 0.0.


      The countdown is in second, so setting the value of the variable to 2.0 will

    description: 'Sets the seed for the random number generator.


      The random number generator is not truly random but produces numbers in a preset
      sequence (the values in the sequence "jump" around the range in such a way that
      they appear random for most purposes).The point in the sequence where a particular
      run of pseudo-random values begins is selected using an integer called the  value.
      The seed is normally set from some arbitrary value like the system clock before
      the random number functions are used. This prevents the same run of values from
      occurring each time a game is played and thus avoids predictable gameplay. However,
      it is sometimes useful to produce the same run of pseudo-random values on demand
      by setting the seed yourself.You might set your own seed, for example,  when
      you generate a game level procedurally. You can use randomly-chosen elements
      to make the scene look arbitrary and natural but set the seed to a preset value
      before generating. This will make sure that the same "random" pattern is produced
      each time the game is played. This can often be an effective way to reduce a
      game''s storage requirements - you can generate as many levels as you like procedurally
      and store each one using nothing more than an integer seed value.'

    description: 'Projects a vector onto another vector.


      To understand vector projection, imagine that <b>onNormal</b> is resting on
      a line pointing in its direction. Somewhere along that line will be the nearest
      point to the tip of <b>vector</b>. The projection is just <b>onNormal</b> rescaled
      so that it reaches that point on the line.The function will return a zero vector
      if <b>onNormal</b> is almost zero.An example of the usage of projection is a
      rail-mounted gun that should slide so that it gets as close as possible to a
      target object. The projection of the target heading along the direction of the
      rail can be used to move the gun by applying a force to a rigidbody, say.'

      When confined, the cursor behave normally with the exception of being confined

      the user has clicked on the content and the user has not left the content view

      the cursor will be automatically reset to normal. The cursor state will also
      be lost when exiting full screen mode.To provide a good user experience it is
      recommended to only lock or confine the cursor as a result of pressing a button.
      Also you should check if the cursor was reset, in order to e.g. pause the game
      or bring up a game menu. In the Web Player and Editor the cursor will automatically
      be reset when you press escape. In the Standalone Player you have full control

    description: 'Setting to scale the Canvas to match the width or height of the
      reference resolution, or a combination.


      If the setting is set to 0, the Canvas is scaled according to the difference
      between the current screen resolution width and the reference resolution width.
      If the setting is set to 1, the Canvas is scaled according to the difference
      between the current screen resolution height and the reference resolution height.For
      values in between 0 and 1, the scaling is based on a combination of the relative
      width and height.Consider an example where the reference resolution of 640x480,
      and the current screen resolution is a landscape mode of 480x640.If the scaleWidthOrHeight
      setting is set to 0, the Canvas is scaled by 0.75 because the current resolution
      width of 480 is 0.75 times the reference resolution width of 640. The Canvas
      resolution gets a resolution of 640x853.33. This resolution has the same width
      as the reference resolution width, but has the aspect ratio of the current screen
      resolution. Note that the Canvas resolution of 640x853.33 is the current screen
      resolution divided by the scale factor of 0.75.If the scaleWidthOrHeight setting
      is set to 1, the Canvas is scaled by 1.33 because the current resolution height
      of 640 is 1.33 times the reference resolution height of 480. The Canvas resolution
      gets a resolution of 360x480. This resolution has the same height as the reference
      resolution width, but has the aspect ratio of the current screen resolution.
      Note that the Canvas resolution of 360x480 is the current screen resolution
      divided by the scale factor of 1.33.If the scaleWidthOrHeight setting is set
      to 0.5, we find the horizontal scaling needed (0.75) and the vertical scaling
      needed (1.33) and find the average. However, we do the average in logarithmic
      space. A regular average of 0.75 and 1.33 would produce a result of 1.04. However,
      since multiplying by 1.33 is the same as diving by 0.75, the two scale factor
      really corresponds to multiplying by 0.75 versus dividing by 0.75, and the average
      of those two things should even out and produce a neutral result. The average
      in logarithmic space of 0.75 and 1.33 is exactly 1.0, which is what we want.
      The Canvas resolution hence ends up being 480x640 which is the current resolution
      divided by the scale factor of 1.0.The logic works the same for all values.
      The average between the horizontal and vertical scale factor is a weighted average
      based on the matchWidthOrHeight value.'

      The execution of a coroutine can be paused at any point using the yield statement.
      The yield return value specifies when the coroutine is resumed. Coroutines are
      excellent when modelling behaviour over several frames. Coroutines have virtually
      no performance overhead. StartCoroutine function always returns immediately,
      however you can yield the result. This will wait until the coroutine has finished
      execution.When using JavaScript it is not necessary to use StartCoroutine, the
      compiler will do this for you. When writing C# code you must call StartCoroutine.'

      The explosion is modelled as a sphere with a certain centre position and radius
      in world space; normally, anything outside the sphere is not affected by the
      explosion and the force decreases in proportion to distance from the centre.
      However, if a value of zero is passed for the radius then the full force will
      be applied regardless of how far the centre is from the rigidbody.By default,
      the direction of the force is the line going from the explosion centre to the
      rigidbody''s centre of mass. If you pass a non-zero value for the <b>upwardsModifier</b>
      parameter, the direction will be modified by subtracting that value from the
      Y component of the centre point. For example, if you pass a value of 2.0 for
      <b>upwardsModifier</b>, the explosion will appear to be centred 2.0 units below
      its actual position for purposes of calculating the force direction (ie, the
      centre and the radius of effect are not modified). Using this parameter, you
      can easily make the explosion appear to throw objects up into the air, which
      often gives a more dramatic effect than a simple outward force.Force can be
      applied only to an active rigidbody. If a GameObject is inactive, AddExplosionForce

    description: 'The parameters of wheel''s suspension. The suspension attempts to

      The value suspensionSpring.spring describes the stiffness of the spring. It
      is expressed in Newtons per metre. The spring strength has a profound influence
      on handling by modulating the time it takes for the vehicle to respond to bumps
      in the road and on the amount of load experienced by the tire.  Larger values
      make the suspension reach the target position faster but at the cost of increased
      load and handling variability.  Smaller values provide a smoother but less responsive
      ride.The value suspensionSpring.damper describes the rate at which the spring
      dissipates the energy stored in the spring. It is expressed in Newtons seconds
      per metre (equivalent to Newtons per unit speed). Larger values make the suspension
      reach the target position slower, while lower values make the car appear more
      bouncy.  Vehicle suspensions typically have a response close to critical damping.The
      rest coordinate of the wheel is specified by suspensionSpring.targetPosition.  This
      value describes the rest coordinate of the wheel as a fraction in range (0,
      1) along the <b>suspensionDistance</b>. Zero value maps to full extension along
      the suspension travel,  while a value of one maps to fully compressed suspension.
      Default value is 0.5, which sets the rest coordinate of the wheel to the mid-point
      between the suspension at maximum elongation and maximum compression.  Typical
      values would be in range (0.3, 0.7).'

      from the base of the wheel at its rest coordinate (the rest coordinate of the
      wheel is determined by the value WheelCollider.spring.targetPosition).  This
      parameter simulates the effective roll center of the suspension geometry.  For
      a standard family car the value of forceAppPointDistance should be tuned to
      place the application point approximately 0.3m below the rigid body center of
      mass.  Moving the application point downwards introduces more roll when cornering,
      while moving it upwards results in less roll when cornering. The force application
      point is typically below the rigid body center of mass.Please note that having
      this parameter equal to zero could be undesirable as it contributes to simulation
      instability in certain configurations. Once you observe your vehicle failing
      to go asleep resting on flat surface, exhibiting jittering behavior or drifting
      along the surface when no user input is applied, check the forceAppPointDistance
      values. In the editor, when a WheelCollider game object is selected, there is
      a green spherical gizmo displayed to show where the force application point
      is at the moment. Try increasing forceAppPointDistance value gradually, until
      you''re satisfied with the result.

      Ignoring collisions refers to any type of interaction between the selected colliders
      i.e. no collision or trigger interaction will occur.  Collision layers are first
      checked to see the two layers can interact and if not then no interactions take
      place.  Following that, ignoring specific colliders interactions will occur.IgnoreCollision
      has a few limitations: 1) It is not persistent. This means that the ignore collision
      state will not be stored in the editor when saving a scene. 2) You can only
      apply the ignore collision to colliders in active game objects. When deactivating
      the collider the IgnoreCollision state will be lost and you have to call Physics2D.IgnoreCollision
      again. See Also: Physics2D.GetIgnoreCollision, Physics2D.IgnoreLayerCollision.'

      The position vector is in world space coordinates and units.The nextPosition

      position will match the internal simulation position at the time the script
      Update function is called. This coupling can be turned on and off by setting
      updatePosition.When updatePosition is true, the Transform.position reflects
      the simulated position, when false the position of the transform and the navmesh
      agent is not synchronized, and you''ll see a difference between the two in general.
      When updatePosition is turned back on, the Transform.position will be immediately
      move to match nextPosition.By setting nextPosition you can directly control
      where the internal agent position should be. The agent will be moved towards
      the position, but is constrained by the navmesh connectivity and boundaries.
      As such it will be useful only if the positions are continuously updated and
      assessed. See Also: Warp for teleporting a navmesh agent.'

      does not check for obstruction in the world. For example, you the sourcePosition
      is on the ceiling, a point on the second floor will be returned (if there is
      NavMesh there), instead of floor position on the first floor.The function can
      get quite expensive if the search radius is really big. A good starting point
      for the maxDistance is 2 times the agent height.If you are trying to find a
      random point on the NavMesh, it is better to use recommended radius and do try
      multiple times instead of using one very large radius.'

      Two types of tests are performed depending on if the machine has a public IP
      address present or if it only has a private address (or addresses). The public
      IP address test is primarily for when running a server as no tests are needed
      for clients with public addresses. In order for the public IP test to succeed
      a server instance must be started. A test server will try to connect to the
      IP and port of the local server and thus it is shown in the server is connectable.
      If not then a firewall is most likely blocking the server port. A server instance
      needs to be running so that the test server has something to connect to.The
      other test is for checking NAT punchthrough capabilities. This is a valid test
      for both servers and clients and can be performed without any prior setup. There
      are 4 types of NAT test results (see ConnectionTesterStatus): __Full Cone_,
      <b>Address Restricted Cone</b>, <b>Port restricted</b> and  <b>Symmetric</b>.First
      two types offer full NAT punchthrough support and can connect to any type. Port
      restricted type cannot connect to or receive a connection from symmetric type.
      Symmetric if worst and cannot connect to other symmetric types or port restricted
      type. The latter two are labelled as offering limited NAT punchthrough support.This
      function is asynchronous and might not return a valid result right away because
      the tests needs some time to complete (1-2 seconds). After test completion the
      test result is only returned when the function is called again,  a full network
      test is not redone. That way it is safe to poll the function frequently. If

    description: 'Indicate if proxy support is needed, in which case traffic is relayed
      through the proxy server.


      The proxy server is a solution to connectivity problems with servers as well
      as clients. When a machine has an non NAT punchthrough capable router his connectivity
      options are limited. A game cannot be hosted as nobody external can connect
      to him (only clients on the local network can). By using the proxy server the
      machine can be fully connectable but with the extra cost of having all traffic
      relayed through another server. A non NAT punchthrough capable client can connect
      to any server through  the proxy server, as long as the proxy server is set
      up properly.Unity Technologies does not provide a proxy server for public use,
      so to use this feature you will need to set up your own proxy server. Of course
      it is advisable to set up a proxy server with a public IP address and a lot
      of available bandwidth.When running as a client, just enabling Network.useProxy
      is all you have to do. Connect to the server as usual with Network.Connect().
      All traffic  will be relayed through the proxy server. The servers external
      IP and internal IP still work as usual. So clients can connect to him directly
      without the proxy in case they are located on the same network.When running
      as a server OnServerInitialized(NetworkPlayer) returns a NetworkPlayer structure
      which indicates what the game servers relayed IP/port is, i.e. what port the
      proxy server allocated to the game server.  This is the IP/port others can use
      to connect to. When connecting to the server, the clients don''t treat the server
      any differently than other servers. Technically speaking, they don''t need to
      know at all that the game server is getting help from a proxy server. When using
      the master server you can no longer only rely on the IP/port he registers for
      servers when using proxy support. The proxy server IP address and port which
      the server is using can be placed in the comment field of the data sent to the
      master server. A client which received host information from the master server
      can peek into the comment field and find out if he can use an alternative IP/port
      for that host.IMPORTANT: You should never enable proxy support for both the
      server and the client connecting to him. Unexpected things are bound to happen.'

      They can be used to implement image based rendering effects, dynamic shadows,

      textures is setting them as the "target texture" property of a Camera (Camera.targetTexture),
      this will make a camera render into a texture instead of rendering to the screen.Another
      use case is manually implementing various rendering effects, for example Image
      Effects. There you often get temporary short-lived render textures (GetTemporary
      and ReleaseTemporary functions), and manually render objects into them (see
      Graphics.DrawMeshNow and Graphics.Blit).Keep in mind that render texture contents
      can become "lost" on certain events, like loading a new level, system going
      to a screensaver mode, in and out of fullscreen and so on. When that happens,
      your existing render textures will become "not yet created" again, you can check

    description: 'Control of an object''s position through physics simulation.


      Adding a Rigidbody component to an object will put its motion under the control
      of Unity''s physics engine. Even without adding any code, a Rigidbody object
      will be pulled downward by gravity and will react to collisions with incoming
      objects if the right Collider component is also present. The Rigidbody also
      has a scripting API that lets you apply forces to the object and control it
      in a physically realistic way. For example, a car''s behaviour can be specified
      in terms of the forces applied by the wheels. Given this information, the physics
      engine can handle most other aspects of the car''s motion, so it will accelerate
      realistically and respond correctly to collisions.In a script, the FixedUpdate
      function is recommended as the place to apply forces and change Rigidbody settings
      (as opposed to Update, which is used for most other frame update tasks). The
      reason for this is that physics updates are carried out in measured time steps
      that don''t coincide with the frame update. FixedUpdate is called immediately
      before each physics update and so any changes made there will be processed directly.A
      common problem when starting out with Rigidbodies is that the game physics appears
      to run in "slow motion". This is actually due to the scale used for your models.
      The default gravity settings assume that one world unit corresponds to one metre
      of distance. With non-physical games, it doesn''t make much difference if your
      models are all 100 units long but when using physics, they will be treated as
      very large objects. If a large scale is used for objects that are supposed to
      be small, they will appear to fall very slowly - the physics engine thinks they
      are very large objects falling over very large distances. With this in mind,
      be sure to keep your objects more or less at their scale in real life (so a
      car should be about 4 units = 4 metres, for example).'
